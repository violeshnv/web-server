# Web Server build by XMake.

First, use

~~~bash
xmake
~~~

to build this project, then run the following command to start the server

~~~bash
xmake run web-server
~~~

To test if the server is working, open the browser and access the URL `127.0.0.1:<port>/<file>`.

You can modify the configuration file `config.yaml`.

This is a very immature server that needs to be used gently ðŸ˜Š.
